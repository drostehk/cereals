# Cereals : 

TL;DR : Embrace Fibre

## 

Cereal: What used to be just a kid’s meal is now America’s favorite breakfast. And it makes sense. Cold cereal makes for a fast, easy, and inexpensive meal or a quick and easy snack.

Still, cereal sometimes gets a bad rap for being packed with sugar, low in protein, and generally lacking nutritional value (Hint: If it has marshmallows in it, it probably isn’t good for you—sorry, Leprechauns). But the abundance of choices in the supermarket aisle means there are some healthy options hiding behind Toucan Sam. While these cereals might not have a prize in the box, they’ll fuel you up to start your day off right.

Does a cereal box tell you what's on the inside?

Don't lose sight of what's important to people - as they are the ones who designed the packaging and who the packaging was intended for. Thinking on the far end of the human - machine spectrum will provide you with ways to creep farther up that spectrum.


We're narrowly going to define

* 'what's outside' as the image of front box.
* 'what's inside' as nutricional value, specifically fibre, sugar and calories.

I just wanted to know if they used bright colours in cover art to appeal to childeren's visual preferences, and then stuff them with sugar to make sure they stay hooked.
